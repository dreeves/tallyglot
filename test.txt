a prefix that does not count

This is a test file with some normal prose.
It's full of words with apostrophes, "quotes", hyphen-laden words -- you name it.
Even 😀 emoji, which should count as words. 
But two emoji in a row shouldn't count as two words unless there's space in between. 👍👍

Google docs says this has 69 words (including all this, but not including either instance of the excluded prefix), so hopefully we match?
