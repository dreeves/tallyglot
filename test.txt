This is a test file with some normal prose.
It's full of words with apostrophes, "quotes", hyphen-laden words -- you name it.
Even 😀 emoji, which should count as words. 
But two emoji in a row shouldn't count as two words unless there's space in between. 👍👍

Google docs says this has 60 words (including all this), so hopefully we match?
